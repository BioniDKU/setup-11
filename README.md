# Project YuumeiDKU
An attempt to carry the "IDKU" term onto the new **Windows 11** era. This project was based on code of [**BioniDKU**](https://github.com/BioniDKU/setup/tree/0462478e29288d6a12df273457c6e696f48edc3c) version 300 series.  
Due to breaking changes landed in the August 2023 update of version 22H2 and 23H2, and a lack of interest in pushing the development further, this was announced cancelled on the 28th of the same month. Only this repository was kept for reference purposes. 

**"YuumeiDKU"** is named after the username **`Yuumei`** of an artist that drew [one of my favorite desktop backgrounds](https://www.yuumeiart.com/#/lifes-journey/) (not related to the backgrounds used in this project, which are taken from this beautiful [music video](https://youtu.be/FwWUqQz6Llk?t=230)).
