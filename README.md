# Project YuumeiDKU
An attempt to carry the "IDKU" term onto the new **Windows 11** era, and in doing so, completely redefinding its experience. This project is based directly on the [**BioniDKU**](https://github.com/Bionic-OSE/BioniDKU) upstream, which again, is a total rework of the original [AutoIDKU](https://github.com/sunryze-git/AutoIDKU/tree/8f12315e667a36eb18f412eae669a86e6aeccc70) script.

**"YuumeiDKU"** is named after the username **`Yuumei`** of an artist that drew [one of my favorite desktop backgrounds](https://www.yuumeiart.com/#/lifes-journey/) (not related to the backgrounds used in this project, which are taken from this beautiful [music video](https://youtu.be/FwWUqQz6Llk?t=230)).

This project is current a **work-in-progress**. *Its fate* however, is decided by Microsoft's changes to Windows 11, 'cause boy, it's evolving so fast.
